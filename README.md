# Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)

> **_ATTENTION_**: The EIPs repository has recently [undergone](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7206) a separation of ERCs and EIPs. ERCs are now accessible at [https://github.com/ethereum/ercs](https://github.com/ethereum/ercs). All new ERCs and updates to existing ones must be directed at this new repository. The editors apologize for this inconvenience.

If you would like to become an EIP Editor, please read [EIP-5069](./EIPS/eip-5069.md).
The Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) project aims to standardize Ethereum and its conventions. It tracks improvements through EIPs, categorized into core, networking, interface, ERCs, meta, and informational. EIP-1 governs the publication process. Before writing an EIP, discussion on Ethereum Magicians or Ethereum Research is required, followed by thorough review of EIP-1. This repository is for documenting standards, not for implementation help. Queries should be directed to Ethereum Stack Exchange or relevant discussion threads indicated by the "discussions-to" tag in an EIP's preamble.
## Preferred Citation Format

The canonical URL for an EIP that has achieved draft status at any point is at <https://eips.ethereum.org/>. For example, the canonical URL for EIP-1 is <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1>.

Consider any document not published at <https://eips.ethereum.org/> as a working paper. Additionally, consider published EIPs with a status of "draft", "review", or "last call" to be incomplete drafts, and note that their specification is likely to be subject to change.

All pull requests in this repository must pass automated checks before they can be automatically merged:

- [eip-review-bot](https://github.com/ethereum/eip-review-bot/) determines when PRs can be automatically merged [^1]
- EIP-1 rules are enforced using [`eipw`](https://github.com/ethereum/eipw)[^2]
- HTML formatting and broken links are enforced using [HTMLProofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer)[^2]
- Spelling is enforced with [CodeSpell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell)[^2]
  - False positives sometimes occur. When this happens, please submit a PR editing [.codespell-whitelist](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/config/.codespell-whitelist) and **ONLY** .codespell-whitelist
- Markdown best practices are checked using [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint)[^2]
